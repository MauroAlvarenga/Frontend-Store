# Online Store (FrontEnd Only)

This is a work in progress of a store, but it has only front end HTML and CSS -yet-.<br>
It's part of a course i'm attending, with some personal touches.
The goal is to add a backend to it in the future.

***Live Demo:*** https://tienda-piloto.netlify.app/

## Built with

HTML, CSS (with BEM methodology), JavaScript.

## Design Credits:

This project is part of a course from Juan Pablo de la Torre: https://codigoconjuan.com/.<br>
With some style and color modifications to make it a little bit more "mine".
